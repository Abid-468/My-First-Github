        One Piece follows Monkey D. Luffy, a rubber-bodied pirate who ate a
        Devil Fruit, as he gathers a diverse crew (the Straw Hat Pirates) to
        sail the dangerous Grand Line in search of the ultimate treasure, the
        "One Piece," left by the late Pirate King Gol D. Roger, all to become
        the next Pirate King and pursue dreams, friendship, and adventure. The
        plot centers on epic voyages, battles against powerful foes like the
        World Government and rival pirates, exploring unique islands, and
        uncovering the world's hidden history.
